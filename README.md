# ldmx-multi-arch-test
faster testing with shorter build

Can we pre-build the images for fancy-shmancy Apple M1 owners? We'll see...

### To Dos
- [ ] build successfully in parallel here
- [ ] add custom image tags
- [ ] add method of testing
- [ ] check that the arm64 image works on arm64
- [x] check that `apptainer` still functions properly (at UMN)
- [ ] check that `singularity` still functions properly (at SLAC)
